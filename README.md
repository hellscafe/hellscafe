Hello! I am new here and hoping to collaborate with people much better than I am atjavascript and html. I have a choose-your-own-adventure type of website I am working on and have run into several issues. 
I am a graphic designer by trade and an avid consumer of all things 1980's and 1990's. Any help you may have would be greatly appreciated. Cheesr!
